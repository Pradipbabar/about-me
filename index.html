				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p align="center">I'm 22 years old and I'm a native indian. As a DevOps engineer with several years of
					experience, I have not only honed my coding skills but also gained expertise in streamlining the
					software development process. I work closely with development teams to identify bottlenecks and
					inefficiencies in the software development lifecycle and implement tools and processes to automate
					and optimize these stages. My experience with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
					pipelines has enabled me to ensure that software is delivered quickly and efficiently, without
					compromising quality. Additionally, my expertise in containerization with Docker and orchestration
					with Kubernetes has enabled me to build scalable and resilient infrastructure. I am also proficient
					in various DevOps tools such as Jenkins, Git, Ansible, and Terraform. Overall, my combined skills in
					coding and DevOps make me an asset in delivering high-quality software with speed and efficiency.

							<h3>Automated Deployment with github-action and docker</h3>
							<p>In this project, I worked with a team to implement an automated deployment pipeline using
								docker and github-action. The pipeline included the following stages:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><a href=https://github.com/Pradipbabar/java-devops>Code checkout from Git
										repository</a></li>
								<li>Build and test using Maven</li>
								<li>Build docker image name pradipbabar/coupon-app & pradipbabar/product-app</li>
								<li>Automated functional and performance testing</li>
								<li>Deployment to a production environment upon successful testing</li>
							</ul>
							<p>We also utilized the github-action to define the pipeline as code and make it more
								maintainable. Additionally, we implemented a rolling deployment strategy to minimize
								downtime during production deployments.</p>
							<p>The implementation of this pipeline resulted in faster and more reliable deployments, and
								a significant reduction in manual errors. It also allowed us to easily roll back to
								previous versions if any issue occurs.</p>
							<p>In this project, I developed a multi-service web application using Docker Compose. The
								application consisted of several microservices, including a web frontend, a RESTful API,
								and a database service. Each service was containerized using Docker and managed using
								Compose.</p>
							<p>I utilized Docker Compose to define and run the application’s services in a single
								command, making it easy to set up and manage the application in different environments.
								I also created a single container for the application and used a .yml file to define the
								services, networks and volumes.</p>
							<p>The use of Docker Compose allowed for easy scaling and management of the application’s
								services, and simplified the process of deploying the application to different
								environments, including development, staging, and production. Additionally, I also used
								a private registry to store the images to keep them secure and only accessible for
								authorized users.</p>

      <h3>Automated Deployment with Jenkins and Tomcat</h3>
      <p>In this project, I worked with a team to implement an automated deployment pipeline using Jenkins and Tomcat. The pipeline included the following stages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href=https://github.com/Pradipbabar/java-devops >Code checkout from Git repository</a></li>
        <li>Build and test using Maven</li>
        <li>Deployment to a test environment</li>
        <li>Automated functional and performance testing</li>
        <li>Deployment to a production environment upon successful testing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We also utilized the Jenkins Pipeline plugin to define the pipeline as code and make it more maintainable. Additionally, we implemented a rolling deployment strategy to minimize downtime during production deployments.</p>
      <p>The implementation of this pipeline resulted in faster and more reliable deployments, and a significant reduction in manual errors. It also allowed us to easily roll back to previous versions if any issue occurs.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

      <h3>Multi-Service Application with Docker Compose</h3>
      <p>In this project, I developed a multi-service web application using Docker Compose. The application consisted of several microservices, including a web frontend, a RESTful API, and a database service. Each service was containerized using Docker and managed using Compose.</p>
      <p>I utilized Docker Compose to define and run the application’s services in a single command, making it easy to set up and manage the application in different environments. I also created a single container for the application and used a .yml file to define the services, networks and volumes.</p>
      <p>The use of Docker Compose allowed for easy scaling and management of the application’s services, and simplified the process of deploying the application to different environments, including development, staging, and production. Additionally, I also used a private registry to store the images to keep them secure and only accessible for authorized users.</p>

			<p align="center">Hello! My name is Pradip Babar, I'm 21 years old and I'm a native indian. I have several years of experience coding Front-End and Back-End using different languages, such as HTML/CSS, C#, C++ and Java. I gathered interest in programming when I began high school. I was on the Computer Science track, which meant I was taking programming courses daily through the period I was enrolled. During the three years I was a high school student, I've learned Python,C,C++, Java etc.  I wasn't sure what I could do with a career with Computer Science at the time, but I knew I was excited to see something I created in real time. I was eager to learn new concepts and develop more dynamic projects with these new technologies.
			<br><br>I'm currently attending DR.D.Y.PATIL A.C.S Collage,pimpari, obtaining an Associate's degree in Bsc(Computer Science). </p>
